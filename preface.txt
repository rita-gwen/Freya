I ran into Konstantin Zarubin's web site few years ago when reading his columns on Snob - Russian independent journalism site. I just wanted to have a taste of his fiction, but was lost in it almost instantly: Chestnut Freya, History of Rain Theories and many others. Chestnut Freya resonated so deeply with my vision of this world that the first natual impulse was to share it with my friends, but, alas, I ran into a problem familiar to any immigrant: the language barrier. His stories are in Russian and people around me speak English. Even more annoying was the fact that the author speaks perfect English, but does not want to translate his own books. His point of view on this issue is here: https://kostia.me/english-deutsch/. 
So, the only remaining couse of action was to pick up the author's challenge and translate it myself. In his own words:
"I already knew that I would not be able to tell this story with the only 
true words in my own language. I understood that even if by some miracle I 
would be able to do it and the Russian readers believed me then the 
translators will replace my only true words with their own random words 
forged into unimportant sentences with 99.99999...% probability."
Well, we'll see if English readers believe this story. If you want to believe in the mysteries of the Universe, in kindness, in beautiful nature, stars and horses: here it is for you to read. 

Please note that this is translator's page. Feel free to leave your comments about the translation here. You can leave the comments and questions to the author on his web site here: https://kostia.me/scifi/freyja/#comments . The page is in Russian, but, as I mentioned, he speaks English and is perfectly capable of understanding them.
